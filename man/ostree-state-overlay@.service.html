      In some cases, it's useful to be able to have a directory as part of the
      OSTree commit yet still have this directory be writable client-side. One
      example is software that ships in <code class="filename">/opt</code>.
      <code class="filename">/opt</code> is its own vendor-namespaced alternate file
      hierarchy which may contain both code and state. With state overlays, it's
      possible to have the code part baked in the OSTree, but still allowing the
      directory to be writable so that state can be kept there.
    </p><p>
      Since it's writable, nothing prevents sufficiently privileged code to
      modify or delete content that comes from the OSTree commit. This is in
      sharp contrast with content in <code class="filename">/usr</code>, and more
      closely matches a package manager-based distro.
    </p><p>
      Crucially, this state is automatically rebased during upgrades (or more
      generally, anytime a different OSTree commit is booted). The semantics
      of the rebase are as follows: any state file or directory that modified
      OSTree content is deleted, otherwise it is kept and merged onto the new
      base content (using overlayfs). This mostly matches the semantics of a
      package manager.
    </p><p>
      To enable this feature, simply instantiate the unit template, using the
      target path (in escaped systemd path notation) as the instance name. For
      example, to enable it on <code class="filename">/opt</code>:
    </p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
    $ systemctl enable --now ostree-state-overlay@opt.service<br>
    </p></div></div></div></body></html>
